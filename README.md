# Python Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and examples focused on various programming concepts and libraries, including Abstract Data Types (ADTs), Python Collections, NumPy, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### **1. Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
- Implementation of fundamental ADTs:
  - Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly Linked Lists)
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees (e.g., Binary Search Trees)
  - Graphs and Heaps

### **2. Collections**
- Demonstrates the use of Python‚Äôs built-in collections and `collections` module:
  - Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
  - Specialized collections like `defaultdict`, `OrderedDict`, and `Counter`

### **3. NumPy**
- Features powerful array manipulation using the `NumPy` library:
  - Array creation, slicing, and broadcasting
  - Mathematical operations
  - Statistical functions
  - Linear algebra applications

### **4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Examples showcasing OOP concepts:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance and Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstract Classes and Interfaces
  - Real-world use cases of design patterns
